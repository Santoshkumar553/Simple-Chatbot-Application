# Simple-Chatbot-Application

    This Python script implements a simple chatbot that can respond to specific queries based on predefined patterns. 
    The chatbot uses regular expressions to match user input to the corresponding response patterns, 
    and can understand greetings, name queries, and handle a "bye" to exit the conversation. 
    The main features of this chatbot include an interactive user interface, exit functionality, 
    and pattern-based response generation.
1. Overview
    This Python script creates a simple text-based chatbot using the nltk.chat module for pattern-based responses. 
    The chatbot responds to user queries with pre-defined answers for common inputs such as greetings and goodbye. 
    The script includes the basic capability to take input from the user, generate an appropriate response, and 
    terminate when the user types "bye".
2. Required Libraries
    The script relies on the following libraries:
    - nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): For pattern matching and natural language processing.
    You can install the necessary dependencies by running:
    pip install nltk
3. Functionality
    The chatbot script defines predefined responses for different user inputs using regular expressions. 
    The core functionality involves the following:
    - Input Handling: The chatbot prompts the user to enter text and checks for specific queries.
    - Pattern Matching: Using the nltk.chat module, the input is checked against defined patterns.
    - Response Generation: Once a match is found, the bot generates an appropriate response.
    - Exit Functionality: When the user inputs "bye", the chatbot will end the conversation and print a farewell message.
4. Example Interaction
    Below is an example of the interaction between the user and the chatbot:
    Hello! I am a simple chatbot. Type 'bye' to exit.
    You: hi
    ChatBot: Hello! How can I assist you today?
    You: what's your name?
    ChatBot: I am a chatbot created using Python!
    You: bye
    ChatBot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
5. Conclusion
    This script demonstrates how to build a basic chatbot using Python. By using the `nltk` library and regular 
    expressions, you can easily create a chatbot that responds to specific inputs and enhances user interaction.
    You can extend the chatbot by adding more complex patterns, machine learning models, or connecting it to an 
    external API.
